                        <h4>HTML</h4>
                        <p>I only started studying and coding HTML when I was in my 3rd year in college during our Web Programming class. That was the very first time I experienced it and had fun creating pages with it and used the knowledge during my brief participation in a certain web programming bootcamp.</p>

                        <p>To further enjoy learning web programming, we are also taught how to code using CSS to integrate designs on our HTML pages. While studying CSS during the bootcamp training where we were tasked to clone a certain web page, I have fully realized that I am enjoying doing interfaces</p>

                        <p>Although having only basic knowledge and brief experience with regards to JavaScript, I have also enjoyed using the language and was able to integrate it with certain designs from my previous works and can't wait to further expand my knowledge with this to fully realize my potential with the path that I am taking</p>
